# multi_label_classifier
Multi-label classification is different than multi-class classification.

There are 2 approaches to solve multi-label problem.
  Approach 1: Convert multi-label to multi-class.
  Approach 2: Using scikit-multilearn library.

Here we have used Approach 2.
1. Scikit-multilearn is for multi-label classification that is built on top of the well-known scikit-learn ecosystem.
2. It takes a classifier (from scikit-learn library) and train that model with each label.

Thanks :)
